# NeuronDatabaseExplorationAndAnalysis
This project explores the usefulness of a new system for Augmented Reality interaction with online databases. Specifically, this project uses data from the NeuroMorpho database (NeuroMorpho.org), a website, and the Microsoft Hololens to create a new way for users to explore, interact, and compare neuron structures in augmented reality space.
